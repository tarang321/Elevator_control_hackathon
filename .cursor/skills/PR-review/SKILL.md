**Step 3: Categorize Issues**
- **🔴 CRITICAL BUGS**: Must fix immediately (functional correctness, data corruption, crashes)
- **🟠 MAJOR ISSUES**: Should fix before release (performance problems, API issues)
- **🟡 MINOR ISSUES**: Nice to fix (code quality, minor optimizations)
- **🟢 ENHANCEMENTS**: Future improvements (optional optimizations, refactoring)

**Step 4: Prioritize Fixes**
- Rank issues by severity and impact
- Consider fix complexity vs. benefit
- Identify dependencies between fixes

**Step 5: Consensus Building**
- Agree on final assessment
- Document dissenting opinions if any
- Create actionable fix list
